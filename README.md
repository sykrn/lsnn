# lsnn (Least Square Neural Networks)
> Language : MATLAB

This project is for non-iterative algorithm development which are mostly based on the least square method. 
All of thesee following algorithm are based on single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) structure.
List of algorithms:
* ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) 
  ELM, PCA-ELM (principal component analysis), I-ELM (incremental), EI-ELM (enhanced incremental), DP-ELM (destructive parsimonious), and CP-ELM (constructive parsimonious).
* AIL (Analitycal Incremental Learning)
* LSM (Local Sigmoid Model)
